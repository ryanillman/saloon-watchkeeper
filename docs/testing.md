# Testing

## Host tests and snapshots

```sh
cmake -S sim -B build/sim -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build/sim
ctest --test-dir build/sim --output-on-failure
tools/check-layering.sh
```

`snapshot_smoke` renders every page at each size and palette into `build/sim/snap/`. Engine is rendered with fixture data twice: `-live` and `-fault`. The fault render has the port coolant sender failed.

## Against a real Signal K server

The test server is a local Signal K (2.35 at the time of writing) on `localhost:3000`.

1. Get a write token once:
   ```sh
   python3 -I tools/sk-inject/inject.py access
   ```
   Approve **boat-instruments test injector** with read/write in the admin UI (Security → Access Requests). The token goes to `tools/sk-inject/.token`, which is git-ignored.
2. Play a scenario:
   ```sh
   python3 -I tools/sk-inject/inject.py tools/sk-inject/scenarios/two-engines.json
   python3 -I tools/sk-inject/inject.py tools/sk-inject/scenarios/coolant-null.json
   ```
3. Watch it:
   ```sh
   ./build/sim/sim --board sim800                                 # window
   ./build/sim/sim --capture out.png --after 15 [--page 1]        # headless, saves the screen
   ./build/sim/sk_probe localhost propulsion.port.revolutions     # raw values
   ```

### Expected

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| No engine data on the server | `SK LIVE`, every Engine field flagged (`RPM FAIL`, `COOLANT FAIL`, ...) |
| `two-engines` | Both engines discovered, PORT and STBD columns, values moving |
| `coolant-null` after 10 s | Port `COOLANT FAIL` only. Starboard coolant, oil, volts, and both RPMs stay live |
| `rpm-pickup-fails` after 5 s | `PORT RPM FAIL` only; oil pressure says the engine is running, so everything else stays live |
| `key-off` after 5 s | Starboard dim `OFF` (no crosses), hours still shown; port live |
| `controller-dropout` after about 8 s | Every port field flagged (silent after running); starboard live |
| Server stopped | `SK OFFLINE`, every field flagged within about 2 s |
| Server restarted | `SK LIVE`, fields clear on the next delta |

## On a board

Put a `config.json` (see `docs/config.example.json`) at the root of the SD card, then flash:

```sh
idf.py -D BOARD=lcd7 -B build/lcd7 -p /dev/ttyACM1 flash monitor
```

Run the same scenarios. The board must be on a network that can reach the Signal K server. `"host": "auto"` finds it by mDNS.
